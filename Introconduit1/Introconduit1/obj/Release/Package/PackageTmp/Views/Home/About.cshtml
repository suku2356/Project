    <h2>Who are Introverts exactly</h2>
     <p>“Our culture made a virtue of living only as extroverts. We discouraged the inner journey, the quest for a center.  So we lost our center and have to find it again.” ~Anais Nin
</p>
<p>
    The world is a better place when introverts stay true to who they are.
    In a world that favors extroversion, introverts are often left to wonder, “is there something wrong with me?” This is unfortunate because introverts are awesome and we have so many valuable gifts to offer the world

    <h3>What to know whether you are an introvert or not</h3>
    <p>
        Well, Introverts are people who primarily look inward, paying close attention to their thoughts and emotions. It's not that they are incapable of paying attention to what is going on around them, it's just that their inner world is much more stimulating and rewarding to them.<br />

        You might be one if you are drained by social encounters and energized by solitary, often creative pursuits. Their disposition is frequently misconstrued as shyness, social phobia or even avoidant personality disorder, but many introverts socialize easily; they just strongly prefer not to. In fact, the self-styled introvert can be more empathic and interpersonally connected than his or her outgoing counterparts. The line between introversion and lonely loners gets blurry, however, as some introverts do wish they could break out of their shell.<br />

    <h3>Some really fantastic facts about introverts</h3>
    
    <ul>
        <li><p>Introverts do not tend to have tons of friends. Instead they intensely value their close friends.</p></li>
        <li><p>Being an introvert has nothing to do with shyness, nor does it imply that they are afraid of interacting with others. What it does mean is that introverts often do not interact simply for the sake of interacting.</p></li>
        <li><p>Introverts do not tend to have tons of friends. Instead, they intensely value their close friends. If you have an introvert friend, you probably have an ally for life.
</p></li>
        <li><p>Recharging is important to introverted individuals. Rather than going out all of the time, they place a high value on quiet and restful time so that they can feel refreshed and prepared.</p></li>
        <li><p>Those who are introverted do not necessarily want to be alone all the time. However, they do tend to be more comfortable with their own thoughts than others.</p></li>
        <li><p>Introverts generally prefer to be valued for what they can bring to the table as an individual rather than how well they fit in with a group. Because they prefer to think for themselves, they seldom are left to follow what is thought of as popular.
</p></li>
        <li><p>Introverts cannot be expected to “become” extroverts. They simply have a different temperament and manner of handling things. Sometimes the best solutions come from having a combination of the two personality types.</p></li>
        <li><p>Introverted people are usually very good observers. Because they recognize that sometimes it’s best to be quiet and observe, they often notice small details in things that others might not notice.</p></li>

        <ul>
            <li>Many introverts have been known to thrive in the online world. This is not because they are nerdy or weird, but because this manner of communication allows for more of a chance to think through what is being said.</li>
       <li>Not all introverts will be easy to spot. While most will be more quiet and reserved, this is not necessarily how they are distinguished. Instead, while extroverts gain fulfillment from the outside world, introverts gain fulfillment by seeking within themselves.</li>
